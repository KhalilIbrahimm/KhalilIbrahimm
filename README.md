# 👋 Hi, I'm Khalil Ibrahim

I'm a machine learning student with a deep interest in building AI systems that make decisions, adapt over time, and automate complex tasks. My work focuses on reinforcement learning, AI in finance, and intelligent automation — where models don't just predict, but learn, act, and optimize.

I enjoy turning raw, messy data into insight and action. Whether it's detecting patterns in financial markets, building end-to-end automation pipelines, or designing explainable decision systems, I aim to build AI that works — and works for people.

Let's connect if you're working at the intersection of AI, finance, and automation — or if you share a vision for intelligent, explainable, and data-driven systems.
